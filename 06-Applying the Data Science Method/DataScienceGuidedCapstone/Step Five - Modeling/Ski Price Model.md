Big Mountain resort currently charges $81.00 per adult on weekends. This study was conducted to:

- Gain insight into the price effects of changes to Big Mountain facilities,
- Recommend the strategies to maximize revenue.

 

The following summarizes the prediction model, the scenarios considered and the recommended strategy for revenue maximization.

## Ski Price Model

The price prediction model included state and ski resort data for over 30 ski resorts in the United States. The most important features were:

- vertical_drop
- Snow Making_ac
- total_chairs
- fastQuads
- Runs
- LongestRun_mi
- trams
- SkiableTerrain_ac

Based upon the prices, facilities and demographic data of over 30 resorts in the United States, the model predicted an adult weekend price of $94.22, a 16% increase over current price of $81.00. Even with a mean absolute error of $10.39, this suggests that Big Mountain has room to move.

1. Modeling Scenarios Permanently closing down up to 10 of the least     used runs. This doesn't impact any other resort statistics.
2. Increase     the vertical drop by adding a run to a point 150 feet lower down but requiring     the installation of an additional chair lift to bring skiers back up,     without additional snow making coverage
3. Same     as number 2, but adding 2 acres of snow making cover
4. Increase     the longest run by 0.2 mile to boast 3.5 miles length, requiring an     additional snow making coverage of 4 acres

## Modeling Scenarios

Four scenarios were also modeled to determine impact on price. 

1. Permanently closing down up to 10 of the least used runs. This doesn't impact any other resort statistics.
2. Increase the vertical drop by adding a run to a point 150 feet lower down but requiring the installation of an additional chair lift to bring skiers back up, without additional snow making coverage
3. Same as number 2, but adding 2 acres of snow making cover
4. Increase the longest run by 0.2 mile to boast 3.5 miles length, requiring an additional snow making coverage of 4 acres

 

### Scenario #1

The price and revenue effects of closing up to 10 of the least used runs are exhibited below.

Closing one run had no impact on price. As shown below, closing 2 and 3 runs reduces support for ticket price by up nearly 1% or approximately $144K first year. If 3 runs were closed, Big Mountain may as well close 5 runs since there would be no effect on price. 

[table]

As shown above, closing 6, 7 or 8 runs nearly doubles the price impact from about .8% to over 1.5% or just over $270K first year. Finally closing 9 or 10 runs reduces price support by slightly over 2.1% or nearly #370K first year.

### Scenario #2

Adding a new run and a chair lift increased price support by nearly 2% or an expected amount of nearly $348K.

### Scenario #3

Increasing 2 acres of snow to Scenario #2 had no effect on price.

### Scenario #4

 Increasing the longest run by .2 miles and increasing snow coverage with by additional 4 acres also had no impact on expected price.

## Closing

Based upon this analysis, the scenario #2 presents the best revenue opportunity for Big Mountain. It is also well advised to explore the revenue effects of additional transport investments in FastQuads, additional chairs and trams. Snow making and the number of runs also had an appreciable revenue impact.



# Further Work

The model could be improved with operating cost data, competitor pricing and facilities information, as well as customer surveys. With additional information, an executive scenario planning model could be developed to evaluate investment strategies, conduct A/B tests, and price elasticity studies aimed at long term profit appreciation and value creation.
